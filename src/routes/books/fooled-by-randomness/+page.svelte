    Casually, the quality of the discussion correlates inversely with the luxury of the studios.

    I elected to keep the style of this book as 'idiosyncratic', as it was on the first edition.
    Homo sum, good and bad. I am fallible, and see no reason to hide my minor flaws if they are part of my personality.
    No more do I feel the need to wear a wig when I have my picture taken, or borrow someone else's nose.
    Almost all the book editors that read the draft recommended changes at the sentence level, to make my 'style better'
    and in the structure of the text, in the organization of chapters.
    I ignored almost all of them and found out that none of the readers thought them necessary.
    As a matter of fact, I find that injecting the personality of the author, imperfections included, enlivens the text.

    Does the book industry suffer from the classical "expert problem" with a buildup of rules of thumb that do not have empirical validity?
    More than a hundred thousand readers later, I am discovering that books are not written for book editors.`;

<p>I don't personally like Taleb, nor agree with a lot of his opinions</p>
<p>
	Nonetheless I do enjoy his books and the way they introduce people to a sort of 'statistical
	reasoning' <br />
	Regardless of Your opinions, they will certainly make You consider things from a different perspective
	<br />
	I chose this quote as it talks about what happens to systems that live long enough too meet their disruptors
</p>
<p>
	As an example and to continue the topic of journalism, gone are the days where networks would
	arrange panels and bring in fighters from all corners of the ring to present their take on a
	current topic <br />
	Nowaday's it's a surprise whenever a person shows up that You haven't seen before <br />
	They have inhouse 'experts', like their friend Mike with whom they had dinner last night <br />
	Moreover, You change the channel and hear the same thing being said by a different person <br />
	Long form podcasts are devouring media, and hard as networks try to keep up, they can't <br />
</p>
<p>
	The value of legacy networks lies in their reputation, which is why they've built standardized
	systems <br />
	On what topics they discuss, how they discuss them, whom they invite, what words they use, how much
	time they devote to a topic before switching contexts

<!-- TODO talk about
    reputation and the mask that we put on ourselves
    gatekeeping (technical terms that become too much, keeping people out with new ideas)
    the fear of invalidating Your life's work
    the fear of cannibalization / destructive creation

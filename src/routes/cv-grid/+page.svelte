					>
						<p>
							I was making simulations of elasticity models of steel<br />
							The progress was very slow because getting the data I needed took several weeks <br />
							I automated the steps and got the time down to minutes for the process of
						</p>
						<li>preparing the experimental data to be used in the models</li>
						<li>evaluating the simulation results</li>
						<p>
							I also automated the process of iterating over model parameters between simulations,
							to find optimal parameters and eliminating the need for human supervision during
							long-running, compute-intensive simulations
						</p>
					</ExperienceCard>
					<ExperienceCard
						title="Data analyst"
						place="Design Bestseller"
						date_range="Oct 2019 - May 2022"
					>
						<p>
							The work was very varied
							<li>automating weekly and monthly reports using our exasol data warehouse</li>
							<li>
								creating new reports and engineering features that could be used as KPIs
								<div>
									<li>
										like a dashboard to display our highest impact products to increase average
										order value
									</li>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>scraping external data sources to improve our customer experience</li>
						</p>
						<p>
							I built a couple of models that I sadly didn't get to see through to production
							<li>A market basket analysis model to power a potential recommendation engine</li>
							<li>A customer lifetime value model to better measure our marketing budget</li>
							<li>
								A time series model to predict the availability of products and improve purchasing
								and inventory
							</li>

					<ExperienceCard title="Tech lead" place="Emprende-SEO" date_range="Feb 2021 - Mar 2023">
						<p>
							Emprende-SEO was an enterprise partly owned by me
							<br />
							There I was responsible for:
						</p>
						<li>advising our clients on potential technical solutions</li>
						<li>building applications (like booking systems or APIs)</li>
						<li>automating processes</li>
						<li>integrating external APIs</li>
					</ExperienceCard>
					<ExperienceCard
						title="Software developer"
						place="Brettschneider"
						date_range="Mai 2022 - Mar 2023"
					>
						<p>
							Work at Brettschneider was great, I was tasked with automating processes and had a lot
							of autonomy
						</p>
						<p>
							Our operations were based on MSSQL and our logistics software, I created a python
							codebase for the new services
						</p>
						<li>
							Automating invoices - saved management and accounting a couple of days of work every
							month
						</li>
						<li>Automating weekly reports to our clients - saved a couple of hours every week</li>
						<li>
							Building event-driven systems and integrating provider APIs - allowed us to package
							and ship twice as many collis and save hours in daily operations
						</li>
